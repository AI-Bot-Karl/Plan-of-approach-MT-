\chapter{Restrictions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item To fully demonstrate all abilities of the  FANUC R-2000iC/210F, all sub-processes need to be complete. Also test material will be needed that can be picked up and placed.
	\item The robot arm currently does not have a gripper. To demonstrate the picking abilities in real life with test material, this gripper will need to be designed in time.
\end{itemize}
