The robot needs to be set up to work in cooperation with other subprocesses. Also a control strategy for the robotic arm with efficient movements guided by information from previous subprocesses needs to be implemented in Software.

%2 strategies - picking all parts at once and placing them all together or picking and placing individually
%or find other strategies


% placement position data from the delta robot, velocity signals from the conveyor belts and flags from the press needs to be implemented in software on the accompanying FANUC R-30iB controller and the affiliated Siemens SIMATIC S7-1500 PLC .
