\chapter{Problem Definition}

Assemblies of hot, formable Thermoplastic are delivered on a conveyor belt after being reheated in an oven. 
The assemblies then need to be picked up with a FANUC R-2000iC/210F 6-axis Industrial robot arm from the conveyor belt through a small window in a heat shield that keeps the assemblies warm. 
The Industrial robot then swings over to the press when it is open and the mould is free. 
The assemblies are then placed inside the mould at desired spots while making sure, the robot arm does not collide with any part of the press. 
After all parts are placed, and the robot arm has pulled back in a safe position, the press is activated and forms the parts with heat and pressure. 
When the forming process is finished, the press opens, the product is picked by the robot arm and placed on another conveyor belt for further processing. 
As the press is free, the cycle can repeat.
